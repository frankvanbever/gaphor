Sphinx Extension
================

What's more awesome than to use Gaphor diagrams directly in your `Sphinx`_ documentation.
Whether you write your docs in `reStructured Text`_ or `Markdown`_, we've got you covered.

.. tip::

   Here we cover the reStructured Text syntax. If you prefer markdown, we suggest you
   have a look at the `MyST-parser <https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/>`_, as it
   `supports Sphinx directives <https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/roles-and-directives.html>`_.

It requires `minimal effort to set up <#configuration>`_. Adding a diagram is as simple as:

.. code:: rst

   .. diagram:: main

.. diagram:: main
   :model: example

In case you use multiple Gaphor source files, you need to define a ``:model:`` attribute
and add the model names to the Sphinx configuration file (``conf.py``).

.. code:: rst

   .. diagram:: main
      :model: example

Diagrams can be referenced by their name, or by their fully qualified name.

.. code:: rst

   .. diagram:: New model.main

`Image properties`_ can also be applied:

.. code:: rst

   .. diagram:: main
      :width: 50%
      :align: right
      :alt: A description suitable for an example

.. diagram:: main
   :model: example
   :width: 50%
   :align: center
   :alt: A description suitable for an example


Configuration
-------------

To add Gaphor diagram support to Sphinx, make sure Gaphor is listed as a dependency.

.. important::

   Gaphor requires at least Python 3.9.

Secondly, add the following to your ``conf.py`` file:

Step 1: Add gaphor as extension.

.. code:: python

   extensions = [
       "gaphor.extensions.sphinx",
   ]

Step 2: Add references to models

.. code:: python

   # A single model
   gaphor_models = "../examples/sequence-diagram.gaphor"

   # Or multiple models
   gaphor_models = {
       "connect": "connect.gaphor",
       "example": "../examples/sequence-diagram.gaphor"
   }

Now include ``diagram`` directives in your documents.

Optionally you can configure Gaphor to make the generated diagrams links to the
images. This might make sense if you have large diagrams that become unreadable
due to the constraints of your Sphinx theme. To enable this feature set
``gaphor_diagram_links`` to true:

.. code:: python

   gaphor_diagram_links = True

Read the Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The diagram directive plays nice with `Read the docs`_.
To make diagrams render, it's best to use a `.readthedocs.yaml`_ file in your project.
Make sure to include the extra ``apt_packages`` as shown below.

This is the ``.readthedocs.yaml`` file we use for Gaphor:

.. literalinclude :: ../.readthedocs.yaml
   :language: yaml

* ``libgirepository1.0-dev`` is required to build PyGObject.
* ``gir1.2-pango-1.0`` is required for text rendering.

.. note::

   For Gaphor 2.7.0, ``gir1.2-gtk-3.0`` and ``gir1.2-gtksource-4`` are required ``apt_packages``, although we do not use the GUI.
   From Gaphor 2.7.1 onwards all you need is GI-repository and Pango.


Errors
------

Errors are shown on the console when the documentation is built and in the document.

An error will appear in the documentation. Something like this:

.. error::

   No diagram ‘Wrong name’ in model ‘example’ (../examples/sequence-diagram.gaphor).
